			<h2>Character</h2>
			<p>
				Mai Sakurajima - Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai series. She is a notable actress/model and a third year at Minegahara High School, the same school as Sakuta Azusagawa. Mai is an attractive individual with waist-length black hair that has bangs hanging on the left side with a bunny-shaped barrette in the back, blue-purple eyes and a slender, well defined body. She's fairly tall for a Japanese girl, standing at a height of 165 cm.

			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>
				Mai found early fame as a model for television, magazines, and books, due to the fact that her mother ran a photographing agency. While she did enjoy her job as a model in the show business, the pressure of being in the public began to take it's toll on her. After being tricked forced to participate in a swimsuit photoshoot by her mother in her third year of middle school, despite making clear over the years that considered such photoshoots unacceptable, Mai realized she was simply used as a tool to make her mother easy money and took a hiatus from acting as a way to get back at her, and decided to attend highschool. However, because of work commitments made prior to her decision to go on hiatus she wasn't able to attend school until half-way through her first year. By then, social circles had formed, making her the "odd one out" causing her to be isolated. As a result, the student body didn't know how to deal with her; While they had no reason to bully her, they also feared associating with her would cause themselves to be isolated as well. Unbeknownst to Mai, these events caused a severe emotional disturbance in her and the effects of Adolescence Syndrome caused her existence to become unnoticed by other people. Something that she soon discovered, and while she first enjoyed a respite from the spot-light she soon realized she was in peril of disappearing altogether.

			<p4>Plot</p4>
			<p>
				Two years and several months since beginning her hiatus, Mai went to a library wearing a bunny costume to see if anyone would notice her. She then came across a boy named Sakuta Azusagawa, who was the only person in the building who was able to see her. After introducing themselves however, Mai ordered Sakuta to forget about her.

The next day, she was seen walking to school by Sakuta and his friend Yuuma Kunimi. After school in a train station, Mai overheard Sakuta scaring a teenage boy from taking a picture of her and thanked him for it. She did add that she was used to such situations, but confirmed Sakuta's subsequent guess that they still wore her down. The two boarded the train, where Mai becomes flustered after Sakuta mentioned how the bunny suit she wore made it impossible to forget about her. After a brief conversation about Sakuta's involvement in the "hospitalization incident" (which he confirmed that he had no involvement), Mai told him about her history as an actress; she loved the job, but it gradually became stressful to the point that she wanted to be in a world where nobody knew who she was. The two leave the train at Fujisawa station, where she went on to add that she started to notice that at the beginning of a 4-day weekend, no one was able to see or hear her, save for some people at Fujisawa; she would then go around in a bunny suit to see if anyone else would notice her. Mai then attempted to order a custard bun, but her invisibility forced her to let Sakuta do that instead. The latter suggested that her invisibility may have resulted from Adolescence Syndrome, which Mai dismissed that as an urban legend. To prove its existence, Mai was invited to Sakuta's home to see the three scars on his chest and to hear the abnormal circumstances that caused them, while also introducing herself to his sister Kaede Azusagawa. Mai angrily told him to mind his own business after being suggested to return to show-biz, before storming out of the house. However, she was later found by Sakuta outside his apartment for some food and more importantly, to tell him that more people are unable to see her.

			<p5>Relationships</p5>
			<p>

				Sakuta Azusagawa -

She tells Sakuta that she loves him more than he thinks, to which he does not think so until the two become involved in Shoko Makinohara's Adolescence Syndrome
For supernatural reasons, Sakuta is one of the people that can see and remember Mai. Due to his own traumatic past with Adolescence Syndrome, he is one of the only individuals who can relate to and sympathize with her. In turn Mai holds a special affection for him as someone she can depend on, such as when she credited him as the influence behind her return to show business and asked for his privacy not to be violated during a press conference. While she recognizes that Sakuta will not cheat on her, such as with Tomoe Koga when he pretended to be her boyfriend, she is not surprised due to his kind nature and his willingness to go great lengths for people he cares about. Aware of Sakuta's sarcastic and joking nature, she'll generally react against it but every so often she plays along.

She tells Sakuta that she loves him more than he thinks, to which he does not think so until the two become involved in Shoko Makinohara's Adolescence Syndrome.
